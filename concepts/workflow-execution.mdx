Workflow execution on KWALA is the process of running your defined actions in response to triggers. The KWALA network handles all the heavy lifting from monitoring blockchain events to executing actions across multiple chains — without requiring you to manage servers or infrastructure.

## Execution modes

KWALA supports two execution modes that determine how your workflow actions are processed:
