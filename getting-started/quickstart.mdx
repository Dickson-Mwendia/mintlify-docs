Before you can create and run KWALA workflows, you need to set up your wallet and get KWALA credits. This guide walks you through the complete setup process in three steps.

## Step 1: Connect your Web3 wallet

You need a MetaMask wallet to purchase KWALA credits and run workflows.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install MetaMask">
    If you don't already have MetaMask, download and install it from [metamask.io](https://metamask.io). You'll need to:
    - Create a new wallet or import an existing one
    - Save your recovery phrase securely
    - Configure it for BNB Smart Chain network
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Navigate to the KWALA dashboard"> 
    Open the [KWALA dashboard](https://kwala.network/dashboard), and select **My Workflows** to access the workflow builder.

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Connect your wallet">
    On the dashboard, select the **Connect Wallet** button. This will redirect you to connect via MetaMask.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Authorize connection">
    Approve the connection request in your MetaMask wallet to link it with the KWALA network.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify connection">
    Once connected, you'll see your wallet address displayed in the dashboard. You can disconnect your wallet at any time by selecting your address. 
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Purchase KWALA credits

KWALA uses a credit-based system to execute workflows. Follow these steps to add KWALA credits to your account:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the KWALA payments page">
    Navigate to [payments.kwala.network](https://payments.kwala.network/) to access the payment portal.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Purchase credits">
    Choose your preferred payment method:
    - **Wallet Swap**: Directly swap USDT for KWALA credits from your connected wallet (instant)
    - **Easy Transfer**: Send USDT to a provided address to purchase credits
  </Step>
</Steps>

For a detailed step-by-step guide on purchasing KWALA credits, including wallet connection and payment methods, see our [Get KWALA Credits](/getting-started/get-kwala-tokens) guide.

## Step 3: Build your first workflow

Once your wallet is set up and you've purchased credits, you're ready to create your first KWALA workflow.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create new workflow">
    Select the **Create Your First Workflow** or **New Workflow** button on your dashboard.
    <Frame>

    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose a starting point">
    You can either:
    - Start from a blank workflow
    - Use a pre-built template
    - Import an existing YAML file
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure your workflow">
    Use the workflow editor to configure:
    - **Name**: Give your workflow a descriptive name
    - **Execution mode**: Choose parallel or sequential execution
    - **Triggers**: Define when your workflow should run (event-based or time-based)
    - **Actions**: Specify what the workflow should do when trigger conditions are met (deploy contracts, call APIs, send notifications)

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test your workflow">
    Before you deploy the workflow, use the test feature to validate your configuration.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Deploy and execute">
    Once you're satisfied with your workflow, deploy it to the KWALA network and execute it.
  </Step>
</Steps>
